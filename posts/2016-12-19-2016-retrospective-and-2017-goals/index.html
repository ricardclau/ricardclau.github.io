And here we are again doing some <strong>retrospective</strong>.</p><p>I know this is a cheap way to avoid visiting a psychologist but somehow, writing these posts helps me create piece of mind. And many people have told me they like reading them so it´s a win-win situation!</p><p>I started the year with a new role: <strong>Automation Team Lead at Wonga</strong>.</p><p>Wonga is a <strong>financial services</strong> organisation with presence in multiple countries, operating in a heavily regulated environment and this involves a lot of challenges in terms of automation. Plus, to make things better, the company had gone through massive turnover and they turned into a bit of a corporate environment in order to get <a href=https://www.fca.org.uk/>FCA approval</a>.</p><p>And in <strong>corporate environments</strong> you get people who don´t understand technology at all. People who believe making you change your password every 30 days makes it more secure than introducing 2 factor auth. People who force you to change your AWS Console password but not your keys. People who pretend to install <strong>spy software</strong> in your laptop.</p><p>One of the most repeated answers to every single question I put was <em>&#8220;we are financial services, we cannot do that&#8221;</em>. But there was never a technical or legal reason! Someone just misunderstood what the <strong>PCI requirements</strong> were, they told some non-technical manager and they made everyone´s life more difficult for no reason.</p><p>But even with all these constraints my team managed to improve things a lot. We succesfully introduced automation with <strong>Ansible</strong>, both for Linux and Windows, we changed the way some things were managed (internal APIs through automated <strong>HaProxy</strong>, time series metrics everywhere with the <strong>Telegraf</strong> agent and <strong>InfluxDB</strong>), server images creation with Packer both in <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>VMWare Vsphere</strong> and even Terraform automation in both environments.</p><p>Me and my colleague <strong>John Paul Newman</strong> did a nice talk about all these plans and work in progress at the excellent <strong>London DevOps</strong> meetup. You can check the slides at</p><iframe style=width:100%;height:500px frameborder=0 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 scrolling=no src=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/haZn1ImpnK4Vus allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><p>or even watch the video at</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=//www.youtube.com/embed/4nIwKBqCbMg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>And I also did a solo talk at the Winops meetup about using Packer in Windows. Unfortunately, there is no video but you can check the slides at</p><iframe style=width:100%;height:500px frameborder=0 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 scrolling=no src=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/rcoo1zA88N1Kh allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><p>But there was a problem with all this.<br><strong>Massive resistance to change</strong> from many developers who have been in the company for so long they don´t know anymore what´s out there. And truth be told, management said they supported what we were doing but at the same time they did not encourage teams to follow our principles.</p><p>No surprise, I found out this was not the right environment for me after just a few months.</p><p>But there was something else about to happen! <strong>We were having a baby!</strong> And you don´t want to change jobs just before having a baby, do you? Our <strong>gorgeous little Julia</strong> was born in August and during paternity leave I decided that not only I wanted to leave Wonga but also <strong>I wanted to move back home</strong>. At the end of the day, London is a great city but it is not very kid friendly. And time has proven us right on that! So many idiots in the tube!</p><p>So when I came back from paternity leave I presented my resignation and started looking for a new job in Barcelona. Notice periods in London are usually about 3 months so I had plenty of time!</p><p>I spoke to a small number of companies in Barcelona and after some interviews I was lucky to be able to choose between 2 very good offers and after a lot of thinking I decided to become <strong><a href=https://www.holaluz.com>Holaluz new CTO</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Living abroad has been a great experience</strong> but we felt it was over for us as soon as we had our little one. Many adventures ahead!</p><p>Let´s see how I did this year with my goals:</p><p>– Keep improving my technical skills -&gt; Yes!<br>– Improve my management / leadership skills -&gt; I think I did what I could considering the environment I faced, the budget constraints and the team I found but I guess I gave up soon<br>– Give a talk in some non-PHP meetup / event -&gt; not only one but 2 of them!<br>– Take things easier! -&gt; mmmmm with a little one it is not that easy!</p><p>And let´s set some goals for 2017:</p><p>– Be a good CTO and build a high performant team at Holaluz<br>– Go back to do some sport<br>– Give some talks in Barcelona<br>– Get the AWS certifications</p><p>How did 2016 treat you?</p></div></article></main></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2021 Ricard Clau.
