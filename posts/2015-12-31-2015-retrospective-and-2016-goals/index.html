A year of reinvention, regeneration and most importantly, making peace with myself. Most of it has happened at a personal level but it has also affected my work.</p><p>I have spent all year working at <a href=http://www.anotherplaceproductions.com target=_blank>Another Place Productions</a>, a small video game studio in London where I have been able to improve my <strong>DevOps</strong> knowledge a lot as I was in charge of all the <strong>backend and infrastructure</strong>.</p><p>I decided to use <strong>Ansible</strong> for provisioning and host everything in <strong>AWS</strong> and I must say this was a really good decision. Ansible is very easy to get started with and it works really well in cloud environments. I am not 100% sure about its SSH push model targeting thousands of servers and some people say it is very easy to screw up with big infrastructures as <strong>Puppet</strong> or <strong>Chef</strong> are better suited but I did not face any of these inconveniences.</p><p>I have also been able to learn about modern Java development thanks to the <strong>Reactive Platform from Typesafe</strong> using <strong>Play Framework</strong>, <strong>SBT</strong> and <strong>Akka</strong>. If you havenÂ´t had time to play with it, give it a go. This is not the Java you remember from high-school, it is super quick and the Akka actors model makes it a brilliant choice for real time applications. Plus, <strong>the JVM has been battle tested</strong> during the last 20 years and it is surely not going anywhere. Even if you donÂ´t like Java, you can use other JVM languages like <strong>Scala</strong> or <strong>Clojure</strong> and still benefit from the stability of the most popular Java libraries.</p><p>Finally, I had to create a crappy backoffice where I used <strong>Symfony2</strong> and <strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong>. I am still terrible at frontend development but Symfony2 has not had many killer new features lately so I was able to produce something decent fairly quickly.</p><p>But not everything was fine there.</p><p>I have been <strong>working on my own</strong> for 15 months and this was very hard for me. It is great to be able to work alone for a while, you get to make all the decisions and you feel empowered. But the truth is you always need someone to discuss your ideas with and I truly missed being part of a bigger team.</p><p>Apart from that, I joined them with the idea of launching the game in February-March, the backend and infrastructure were more or less ready back then but <strong>everything got delayed significantly</strong> and I havenÂ´t had much to do for the last 6 months. Again, it is great to be relaxed for a while but it ends up killing your morale and at some point I was feeling totally useless.</p><p>And finally, because of these delays, the company had to <strong>make some hard calls</strong>. I understand their reasons and I would have probably done the same in their situation but I sometimes disagreed and my opinions were never listened.</p><p>So, with all this in mind and after realising my stock options were close to useless (check my incoming post about the stock options in early stage startups) I decided to let it go. I did a bunch of interviews (check my incoming post about our adventures interviewing both in Barcelona and London) and I finally decided to <strong>join a Fintech company</strong>. It was not an easy decision but I have a strong sponsor inside and I think I will be able to keep growing as a <strong>Team Lead in a DevOps environment</strong>. I am starting in January and I am really excited about the opportunity! LetÂ´s see how it goes!</p><p>Aside from work, I have been quiet in the community.</p><p>I gave a nice talk back in February in the <strong>10th PHP UK Conference</strong> about <strong>&#8220;Modern Software Architectures&#8221;</strong> but I havenÂ´t spoken again since then. I donÂ´t have much to say related to PHP these days and I am possibly not proficient enough in other technologies to be elected in tech events. I guess I will have to reinvent myself as a speaker!</p><p>In terms of open source, I started the year patching the great <a href=https://github.com/edasque/DynamoDBtoCSV target=_blank>DynamoDBToCSV</a> library from <a href=https://github.com/edasque target=_blank>Erik Dasque</a>. Yeah, a NodeJS library! I added support for all the complex types and I wonder why there is no such built-in functionality in AWS for DynamoDB tables. Anyway, if you ever need to export them to CSV, give this library a go!</p><p>But the highlight this year has been the <a href=https://github.com/ansistrano target=_blank>Ansistrano</a> project. I was looking for a <strong>Capistrano</strong> like project written in <strong>Ansible</strong> and it turned out my friends <strong>Carlos Buenosvinos</strong> and <strong>Christian Soronellas</strong> had developed it at <strong>Atrapalo</strong>. They asked me to join the project and I have been adding features and reviewing pull requests for the last 8-9 months.</p><p>And it looks like the project is having some traction, we have <a href=https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy/stargazers target=_blank>more than 330 stars in Github</a>, <a href=http://ansistrano.com/ target=_blank>more than 2700 deployments have been done</a> since we added the anonymous stats counter and lots of well known companies are using it! Doing open-source is always good but if you get people to actually use your stuff it is very rewarding. LetÂ´s see if I can continue doing great open source in 2016!</p><p>Apart from that, we have started exploring the possibility of moving back to Barcelona this year.</p><p>For the first time in 3 years, recruiters and companies from there contacted me and many other emigrants. Barcelona startups have killed it this year as you can regularly read at <a href=http://novobrief.com/ target=_blank>Novobrief</a> and check for open position at the excellent <a href=http://www.jobsbcn.com/ target=_blank>JobsBCN</a> project.</p><p>We were very close to move back but <strong>my wife got an interesting QA job</strong> and although we are starting to <strong>feel homesick</strong> we still believe we have things to do in London before leaving. However, this list of things is becoming shorter and shorter so if our new jobs donÂ´t work out as expected, we will strongly consider any interesting possibilities in the months to come. Anyway, we donÂ´t see ourselves in London forever so weÂ´ll see!</p><p>Time to review this yearÂ´s goals:</p><ul><li>Give a talk in some non-PHP meetup / event -&gt; NO!<br></li><li>Keep improving my technical skills -&gt; ThatÂ´s a definite YES<br></li><li>3M DAU in our incoming game in Another Place Productions -&gt; Nope, although I believe the infrastructure should work<br></li><li>Take things easy ðŸ™‚ -&gt; Some improvements here, more to come! ðŸ™‚</li></ul><p>Goals for 2016:</p><ul><li>Keep improving my technical skills<br></li><li>Improve my management / leadership skills<br></li><li>Give a talk in some non-PHP meetup / event</li><li>Take things easier!</li></ul><p>How did 2015 treat you?</p></div></article></main></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2021 Ricard Clau.
